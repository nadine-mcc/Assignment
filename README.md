Launch jupyter-notebook directly from Anaconda Navigator and navigate to the folder where ‘Assingnment – NI Hospitals’ is located. Make sure that the ‘newproject’ environment is activated.

Activate the newly created environment (conda activate newproject). Launch jupyter-notebook (jupyter-notebook.exe), which should launch a web browser window, which should give an overview of the current folder.
